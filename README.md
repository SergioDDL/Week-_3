What is our overall conversion rate?
`````  58%

    SELECT 
    session_guid, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'package_shipped' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_completed

What is our conversion rate by product?

This is calculated  total by count for each product. 

WITH sessions_by_products AS

    SELECT 
    b.session_guid,
    b.product_guid,
    a.inventory

Part 3: We’re starting to think about granting permissions to our dbt models in our snowflake database so that other roles can have access to them.

Created macros to ensure values are not correctly above 0
created a macro to grant access to the data wharehouse by role



Part 4:  After learning about dbt packages, we want to try one out and apply some macros or tests.

created a macro that tests values and this macro can easily be convered in jinja to test:


Part 5: After improving our project with all the things that we have learned about dbt, we want to show off our work!

I am uploading the lineage graph in the project. done.

Part 6. dbt Snapshots

Pothos, Bamboo, Philodendron, Monstera, String of pearls, ZZ Plant
